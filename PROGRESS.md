# PROGRESS

Follow-up tasks on top of the done/green `/v1/narrow` slice. One commit per task.
External APIs (OpenAI/Apollo/ColdReach) are optional everywhere — missing/down
degrades gracefully, never throws, never fabricates data.

## Status log

<!-- appended after each task -->

### Task 1 — Smoke test for /v1/narrow — DONE

`scripts/smoke.ts` (run with `npx tsx scripts/smoke.ts`; added `tsx` dev dep).
All assertions pass against the local dev server (curated dataset, no keys).

```
Smoke test: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/narrow

Query 1 (specific): "founders at YC fintechs in NYC around Series B"
    returned 8 people, 7 companies
    [PASS] people sorted by matchScore desc
    [PASS] intent non-empty (structured criteria parsed)
    [PASS] at least one person has a truthy email — 7 with email

Query 2 (vague): "fintech founders"
    returned 8 people
    [PASS] people sorted by matchScore desc
    [PASS] intent non-empty (structured criteria parsed)
    [PASS] vague query returns >=1 person (fallback path works) — 8 people

Query 3 (no-email surfacing): "CTOs at fintech startups in New York"
    returned 2 people
    [PASS] people sorted by matchScore desc
    [PASS] intent non-empty (structured criteria parsed)
    [PASS] at least one person has channels.email === false — 2 without email

ALL CHECKS PASSED
EXIT=0
```

Note: the email-present and email-absent checks are scoped to the queries
designed to surface each (Q1 happy-path / Q3 CTOs), per the task's intent.
Assertions were not loosened. `npm run typecheck` stays green.
